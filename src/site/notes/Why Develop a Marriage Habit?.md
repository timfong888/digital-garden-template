TLDR: The moment you exchange vows, your marriage starts a slow boil -- and you are the frogs in the pot! You won't notice it. But if you don't lower the temperature with regular, impactful habits, it will be too late!

## let the boil begin

You know the frog in the pot story?

I'm going to tell you, because you are the frog. 


Wouldn't you want to know what kills the frog in this story?

It's the boiling water. No surprise. 

But that's the wrong question to ask. 

What starts the slow boil to begin with? 


## all marriage problems start the same way

Are you in the middle of a stagnating marriage?

Are you in the honeymoon period wondering "What's all the fuss. I got this!"

Maybe you grew up with examples of great marriages. 

Maybe you don't have a clue. 

Regardless of your background or outlook, any marriage problem you have now or will have in the future starts the same way. 

That "slow boil" begins with a fire beneath the pot. 

It's this thing which begins to heat up the water imperceptibly at first. But if you were to actually get out of the pot and look down below and touch it with your webbed legs, you'd notice it. 

The flame, this problem that heats the pan, is your "junk". It's you. And the same with your spouse. 

No matter who you are, you have stuff that is slowly corroding your marriage. 

Your spouse has the same. Whether you have more or less doesn't matter. Because you are in the same pot of slowly boiling water. 

Now, from outside the pot hearing this tale, what is your response?
