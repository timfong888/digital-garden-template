### the problem
A marriage cannot thrive in isolation. 

Yet many couples disconnect from community over time.

It starts because of their busy schedule.  It worsens once kids enter the picture.

Now, when there are problems, they have no one to support or correct them onto the right path.

Each one relies upon their own strength, their own understanding.

### the lie
The notion that a couple only needs each other for a successful marriage is a myth. 

They believe their relationship is enough. Or that others cannot understand their unique situation.

Or perhaps that everyone else has it together, so they don't both to ask for help.

The lie often sounds like this:

> "It's just us against the world"

The lie amplifies itself as the water boils.

### the pain
Feeling that you are doing it alone makes the challenges so much harder.

Applying the spiritual truths, breaking through false peace, and knowing how to refresh yourself through the Gospel is too hard alone.

Now each of you are going at it alone.  

Left to your own devices, things worsen.  The water gets hotter.

### the promised land
God created us for community.

This is especially true in marriage. 

The promised land is finding and cultivating authentic community with other married couples who can speak truth and model grace.

### the truth
The truth is we need other people to help build a strong, Godly marriage. 

But not all couples are safe and wise.

Those who speak into your life should do so from a common source of spiritual wisdom, not worldly opinions.

Accountability to others helps us identify our own weaknesses and push past them. 

This is simple, but hard.

It may be the lifeline you need.

### your next step
Make finding and connecting with like-minded married couples in your church and community a priority. 

Meet together regularly to share struggles and insights.

Find ways to mutually support each other's marriages and spiritual growth. 

Start with consistency to build a habit.  Check out the devotions at themarriagehabit.com
