Even with a perfect environment without kids, no commute, no office politics, and great real estate, Adam and Eve messed up their marriage.

They took their eyes off of God.

They fell into temptation.

They introduced sin that now runs through the blood of every married couple. On top of that, thanks to them, all of us must also contend with a fallen, wicked world within our own marriage.

So...what do habits have to do with this?

> “Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day. Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me.” ‭‭Psalm‬ ‭119‬:‭97‬-‭98‬ ‭ESV‬‬

It's become a platitude to say that the best habit is to spend time in God's word.

While the statement is true...I feel it's not helpful.

I believe every marriage needs a habit of daily marriage devotionals -- devotionals designed to address the realities of marriage, not just verses for us to delight in the presence and knowledge of God.

The Problem: All marriages start as the frog in a pot of cool water...that's sitting on a lit stove.

The rest of this series covers the following:

- False Peace is No Peace
- Be Spiritually Wise, Not Worldly Foolish
-

But then someone starts a low flame beneath the pot.

Read on next to find out what that flame means for you and your marriage!

“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.”

‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15‬:‭22‬ ‭ESV‬‬
