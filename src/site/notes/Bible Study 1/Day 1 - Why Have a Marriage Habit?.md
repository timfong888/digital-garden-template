## the problem
Even with a perfect environment without kids, no commute, no office politics, and great real estate, Adam and Eve **messed up their marriage.**

They took their eyes off of God.

The rest of this series covers the following:

- False Peace is No Peace
- Be Spiritually Wise, Not Worldly Foolish
- Cool the Withering Heat

But then someone starts a low flame beneath the pot.

Read on next to find out what that flame means for you and your marriage!

“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.”
