## problem
When we encounter a marital problem, we often don't know how to address it!

So we don't. 

This results in resentment and bitterness.  

The water is boiling.

## the lie
We think that a false peace is better than the confrontation. 

It is partially true: endless fighting, arguments, disrespectful tones, will lead to despair and distance. 

So we withold the truth to prevent the pain of conflict.

We may even lie to ourselves we hold our tongue to not hurt the other person.

## the pain
As a result, distance grows and bitterness deepens its roots. 

The problems thicken.  The temperature rises.

Eventually you treat each others as roommates. 

Then one of you, unable to contain their resentment, asks for a divorce. Ironically this hurts their spouse far more than had they been able to breach the issue. 

## the promised land
The actual Promised Land isn't a perfect marriage.  

It's the safety, grace, and trust in God's word to allow a "working out" of each other's sanctification together without condemnation.

The promised land on earth is to experience a sanctifying cycle that redeems our sin through grace and truth. This reminds us of Christ at the cross. 

## the solution
When the two of you agree ahead of time to a daily habit of letting Scripture convict one another, then you can let your spouse up to God's hands. 

Most of the time, let the Word cut to the bone and reveal thoughts. 

Sometimes Scripture will challenge you to speak  the truth or share an unmet need. 

## the action
Start the conversation to have 15-minutes daily to go over such a set of devotions together; to read them or listen to them together and discuss.  

Every day, for 15-minutes.
