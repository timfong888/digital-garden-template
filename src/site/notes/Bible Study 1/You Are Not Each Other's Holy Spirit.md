Problem: we don't know how to address a problem; or know we have a problem
The Lie: better communication; or go to a therapist
The Pain: the issues fester and fester till they explode to the surface, at which time, it's harder to fix
The Promised Land: confidence and conviction without us always needing to call out the other person; that there be safety in us doing so when we do need to do so. 
The Solution: Scriptures that convict, comfort, and cajole us into the right behavior, not for its own sake, but because it's truth; and it's truth that reminds us of grace we've received; that the Holy Spirit is doing the heavy lifting
The Action: Start the conversation to have 15-minutes daily at the same time to go over such a set of devotions together; to read them or listen to them together and discuss.  Every day, for 15-minutes.

let's face it. We all let the minor infractions slip. 

Maybe we do so on purpose. 

Maybe we do so because we don't even know there's a problem. 

The reality is, within a marriage, we can't successfully play Holy Spirit to our spouse. 

We have a hard enough time listening to Holy Spirit ourselves. 

But....

When the two of you agree ahead of time to a daily habit of letting Scripture convict one another, then you can let your spouse up to God's hands. 

Most of the time, let the Word cut to the bone and reveal thoughts. 

Sometimes Scripture will challenge you to speak  the truth or share an unmet need. 

> [!NOTE] Hebrews‬ ‭4‬:‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
> “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”
