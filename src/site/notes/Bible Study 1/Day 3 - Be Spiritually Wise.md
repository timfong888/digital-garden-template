### problem
Now that the water is boiling, you, your partner, or both look around for answers.  Your specific conflicts will differ from couple to couple. 

But underneath all broken relationships are growing distance, resentment, condemnation, and contempt. 

### the lie
Now there's some urgency. Perhaps now you agree to see a therapist. Or you start talking to friends. Or randomly selecting podcasts, books or classes. 

Some may be good. 

But many will not. 

A common refrain from all those sources: decide what is best for you.  Choose you. Punish the other. 

It's a lie 

### the pain
Yet most of the world believes this line of thinking. 

The self-centeredness is masked as wise and compassionate. 

Which leads to further separation. Digging in of heels. Arguments and defensiveness. 

But you can go past this. 

### the promised land
What we want in the storm is knowing the root cause. And to know the salve. 

We know some of it is in ourselves but in this heated moment, cannot face it. 

In nearly every case (minus extreme mental disorder or addiction), the conflict is likely from two dynamics: shame or fear. 

Jesus frees us from shame for our sins and from fear of a just punishment. 

### the truth
Spiritual wisdom can shape your mind and reveal your heart.

Worldly wisdom is foolishness. And foolishness will lead you to destruction. 

### your next step 
Are you ingesting or building a library of human knowledge?  

Or do you have at hand a regular, relevant source of spiritual wisdom in your life?

Assess your intake for how much it directly feeds your marriage. Resolve to make a change with a steady source. 




“For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their own craftiness”;”

““Fools die because they refuse to follow wisdom. They are content to follow their foolish ways, and that will destroy them.”
