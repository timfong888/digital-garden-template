In a perfect environment without kids and work, Adam and Eve messed up their marriage. 

They took their eyes off of God. 

And fell into temptation.

That same sin runs through every married couple who must also contend with a fallen, wicked world. 

So....habits?

> “Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day. Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me.”


The best habit is to spend time in God's word. It's a platitude. And it's hard to do. I get that. 

But it's true.

What is different about this set of 40 is 

These devotionals were written not just as verses for us to delight in the presence and knowledge of God. 

These came from a "smack me in the head" real-life challenges in my own marriage and those of others I counsel.

Had I read these devotions, forty in all for now, on a daily rotation, I could have avoided so much pain. 

These are written to create intimacy, alignment, truth-telling and grace-giving in a marriage. 

Most advise is, understandably, design to save a marriage in free fall. Most because people don't want to do anything until the fire is too hot to handle. 

Problem is, all marriages start as the frog in a pot of cool water. Starts out great. 

But then someone starts a low flame beneath the pot. 

Read on next to find out what that flame means for you and your marriage!
