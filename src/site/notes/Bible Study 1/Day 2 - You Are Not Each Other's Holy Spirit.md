The Solution: Scriptures that convict, comfort, and cajole us into the right behavior, not for its own sake, but because it's truth; and it's truth that reminds us of grace we've received; that the Holy Spirit is doing the heavy lifting
The Action: Start the conversation to have 15-minutes daily at the same time to go over such a set of devotions together; to read them or listen to them together and discuss.  Every day, for 15-minutes.

## problem
Within our marriage, when we encounter a problem, we often don't know how to address it!

Or, even worse, we are are smack-dab in the middle of a problem and we don't even know how to define the problem, just that we don't like it.

This results in resentment and bitterness building.  The water is boiling.

## the lie
The lie is that communication or therapy will lead us to a "perfect" marriage.

It is partially true, nearly all couples can improve "communication".  But communicating often ends up talking at the other person thinking we are communicating at the spouse isn't "getting it." 

That makes things worse.

So then we think the answer is to go to a therapist. 

But many therapists will create a space to communicate more about how much the other person bothers you, making it worse.

And round and round you go!

## the pain
As a result, neither of you have better clarity on either the real problem or a path to resolution.

The problems thicken.  The temperature rises.

Very likely, one person desires to fix things and the other has given up.  This imbalance worsens things and isn't addressed in therapy or by communication.

The ideal state or what paradise looks like grows further and further in each other's minds.

## the promised land
The actual Promised Land isn't a perfect marriage.  It's the safety, grace, and trust in God's word to allow a "working out" of each other's sanctification together without condemnation.

The actual promised land on this earth is to experience a sanctifying cycle that starts with an inevitable sin, but there's truth and grace to correct, confess, and restore the marriage in that moment.

For us, while there is a greater Heaven that awaits, the promised land of today is enjoying that encounter with Christ.  He desired repentenace, trust, and the bearing of good fruits.

## the solution


When the two of you agree ahead of time to a daily habit of letting Scripture convict one another, then you can let your spouse up to God's hands. 

Most of the time, let the Word cut to the bone and reveal thoughts. 

Sometimes Scripture will challenge you to speak  the truth or share an unmet need. 

> [!NOTE] Hebrews‬ ‭4‬:‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
> “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”
