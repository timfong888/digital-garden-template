Being unequally yoked will hobble your relationship. 

The standard of "yokedness" is not whether you both go to church or not. 

==To be equally yoked is to both follow Jesus as Lord.== 

Do not deceive yourself. Or your spouse. 

When you both follow Jesus as Lord, you bend your knee to Him and desire His presence. 

Quiet time with Him takes priority above working out at the gym, watching Netflix, tending to the kids, even working. 

You both seek His comfort and desire to do His will, regardless of what the other person does.  

In your best moments, you gently restore the other through your own words and behavior towards Jesus as Lord. 

If you are unequally yoked, your steps can lead to your spouse's missteps. Your waywardness can cause your spouse to stumble. 

You are both adults and, even when tugged off the right path, are still accountable for your choices. 

But why make it harder for each other by straying from fixing your eyes and heart upon Jesus?

## reflection
Have you checked whether you truly are follow Jesus and His words as if He were your Lord?  What do you think would change and what has been in the way?

When you aren't following Jesus as Lord, you can be leading your spouse astray. 

## share
Share your respective walks and where you are following and where you are straying. 

## prayer
- God, direct our hearts towards Jesus as Lord without reservation or shame
- Give the courage and safety to confess if this is not true; and the power to repent
- Convict is if we cause the other to stumble and if we wander
- Give us the strength to focus on you as Lord
