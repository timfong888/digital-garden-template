**Welcome!**  

You'll start receiving emails from me as I walk with you on this journey of building The Marriage Habit.

To get the most out of this teaching series, subscribe to my podcast.

The Marriage Habit has its own podcast, but the content is part of the overall Acts2 Podcast.

So if you're interested in material outside of Marriage, be sure to check that out.

If YouTube is how you consume content, the same podcast is also broadcast on YouTube:

I am starting to put all 40 habits on a single page (still a work in progress).

If you have already subscribed, you'll get emails about each one.

If not, make sure that you subscribe below:
