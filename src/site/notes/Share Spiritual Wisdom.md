> [!NOTE]  ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭2‬:‭13‬-‭14‬ ‭ESV‬‬
> “And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.”

We are to connect with other believers through **fellowship**. 

Most people mistakenly believe "to fellowship" means to spend time together. 

A marriage should include fellowship between husband and wife.

And for it to have the full bonding power, it does **not** mean socializing together.

The word means "to hold something in common."

One of those bonds of commonality is the indwelling of the Spirit. More tangibly, it means how a man and wife speaks to one another should be through **spiritual truths**. 

Sadly, most couples don't practice the wisdom behind this verse.

### what they do instead
Most couples, including Christian couples, let their conversation be bogged down in "human wisdom."

The practical.  The pragmatic.  The news.  

This is a deadly trap.

Our conversations should include the opposite of such worldly wisdom.

## why?
Something changes when you season your conversations with spiritual truths that both of you understand.

A great intimacy builds when a husband and wife exchange truthfulness that comes from the Spirit. 

They can speak of things that a "natural" or ungenerated person -- themselves before they were regenerated -- cannot understand. 

It's like when a couple has an "**inside joke**."

Each time they reference it, they grow closer. They know what they are talking about because it contains a deeper meaning. 

So it is within a marriage. 

For Christians, this spiritual truth is a conviction of the truth behind Scriptures. Often it can be a thematic verse or a personally meaningful verse that incorporates their Christ-centered worldview. 

The absence of having this intimate shorthand is one of many reasons why there is often a [[Communication Barrier Between the Unequally Yoked\|Communication Barrier Between the Unequally Yoked]]  

Spend time to ensure you are speaking to one another a spiritual truth from your own personal reading of Scripture. 

## reflect
What is a spiritual truth you would like to share with your spouse? 

It can be an active reflection on:

- What has God revealed about Himself recently?
- How has Jesus become more real and precious and magnified to you?
- How have you thought about recent events in the world through God's wisdom?

## share
1. Share with one another the spiritual word you each just reflected on
2. Discuss how it does or doesn't help you to experience fellowship
3. If it doesn't, spend a little time exploring why

## pray
1. Thank God for revealing His word and His spiritual wisdom
2. Ask for eyes and ears to open further to know the true Gospel of grace by faith alone 
3. Invite the Holy Spirit to work in the next 40 days so you have additional wisdom to share
