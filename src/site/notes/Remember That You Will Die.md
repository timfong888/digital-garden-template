When my blood levels for PSA came high it was a reminder to think about the brevity of life. 

Use this to reflect on whatever is going on and ask what changes if tomorrow you or your spouse were to die. 

You going to hold on right?

Be as controlling?

Start something you have been putting of?

Say what hasn't been said?

It's cliche and figuring out the right time frame matters. More like one year to live. 

Discuss this in terms of what you would stop what you would start and what you would keep doing.
