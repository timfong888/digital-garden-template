When my blood levels for PSA came high it was a reminder to think about the brevity of life. 

How easy it is to forget. 

If you want a marriage that has richness, imagine a shorter life. You have no guarantees. 

While in Christ we have eternity, we also 

## reflect
Imagine that you have only one year left to live. 

Look back on the things you have said to and thought about your spouse. 

Would you change anything?  [[Confess to Each Other\|Confess]]?  [[Remember That You Will Die\|Repent]]?  

What would change if your spouse, instead, had one year left to live?

Use this to reflect on whatever is going on and ask what changes if tomorrow you or your spouse were to die. 

Are there things you would release?

Would you start something you have been putting of?

Say what hasn't been said?

It's cliche and figuring out the right time frame matters. More like one year to live. 

## discuss 
Share with each other:

- What would you change?
- What would you start?

## pray
- ==Praise== God for life -- for our very breath 
- ==Ask== for every day to glorify God and to magnify Him through your marriage
- ==Repent== of things that seem small and hurtful with this new perspective 
- ==Yield== to God's will and soften your heart towards your spouse
