> [!NOTE] 1 Corinthians 11:3-9
> But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.

When the household is upside down, God's order is discarded.

I experienced this, where my decisions and concerns became the bottom of my wife's hierarchy.

What took precedence?

Her mother.  The children's schooling.  Her career.  Her emotions and anger.

This doesn't mean that the man is coddled.  But it means the perspectives, counsel, wisdom, direction are considered.

When it comes to weighting, all concerns can be concerned, but with their proper weight.

This created chaos.

Yet many men, themselves, aren't aware of the proper order or how to live it out in a healthy manner.

It will first start with the man ensuring he made Christ his head.

I didn't, in the end, fully live this way by allowing this disruption of order continue and bother me.

There are two potential scenarios when you have this discussion:

1) Wife agrees, and then asks for how it looks
2) Wife disagrees and resists

If she disagress and resist, there's only one course left for the Man, and that is to trust Christ.  

To bring the disrespect, lack of honor, and lack of wisdom to Christ and give the situation up to him.

To persevere in the truth.

This can be very hard when emotions are triggered.

It also means trusting God that, even if a bad outcome occurs due to this disorder in the family, He will ultimately right it.  Through conviction or punishment.

## self reflection
How do you believe your marriage reflects God's order now?
What are your attitudes towards it?
What do you hope to change within yourself?

Discuss with each other your responses to the questions.

## prayer
Ask for conviction and clarity for where you can align with God's order.  Pray that your hearts yearn to align and trust its meaning. Pray for safety and grace to talk about how to align your hearts and actions in a meaningful order.
