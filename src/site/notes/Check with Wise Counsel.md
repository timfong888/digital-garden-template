In this habit agree to schedule time with a wide counselor to hang out and talk about what's going on in your marriage. 

This is not a hang out. It's wise counsel. 

Now this could be to schedule time with a therapist. Or to be part of a [[marriage small group\|marriage small group]]. 

Litmus test: your marriage hits crisis. Whom do you be call?  Can this person speak tough truth to one or both of you?  Does this person has history to identify patterns?

Spend this 15-minute or more ensuring you both have a wise counselor and you have a regular cadence. Yeah i think once every 40 days is great!  

More often a wise set of external eyes the better. 


### why
When you hit a problem you need someone both sides trust. 

One person may be angry and off a cliff. The other may want to reach the other person but can't. 

Having a safe and trusted third party who can bring them back together and be a go between is so important. 

Imagine scrambling to find someone after a major crisis where emotions are running high. 

Tough.
