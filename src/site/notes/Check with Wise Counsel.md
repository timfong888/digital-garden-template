### Introduction
You can avoid the costs of couple's therapy with this one habit. 

What do you **believe** your therapist brings to your relationship?

**Wisdom**. 

You assume they know something you don't. Hopefully they do. 

But before you take that route, consider building a habit of cultivating multiple wise counsel before you need it.

Here's how:

1. Individually, reflect on whom you consider wise
2. Together, share who they are
3. Discuss: what types of wise people do you want in your life for your marriage?
4. Plan: how and when will you reach out?

Want the details so you make the most of this habit?

## why develop your marriage's wise counsel now

Wisdom grows with **time**. 

When it comes to your marriage, wisdom grows in **relationship**. 

For this habit, together agree to schedule time with a *wise counselor* to hang out and talk about what's going on in your marriage. 

This is not a social visit.  It can be social, but it should be intention.

You're discerning and seeking wise counsel. 

There are a couple of ways to do this.

You could choose to **proactively** spend time with a therapist on a regular basis.

Or you can start to cultivate friends, older relatives, perhaps the marriage pastors are your church.

Or to be part of a [[marriage small group\|marriage small group]] where you have shared content, wisdom, and perspective together.

Here's the litmus test: your marriage hits crisis. **Whom do you be call?**  

Can this person or couple speak tough truth to one or both of you?  Does this person have the history to identify patterns?

Spend this 15-minutes or more ensuring you both have a wise counselor and you have a regular cadence.

### pray

1. Pray for the source of Wisdom from God, which comes from a fear of God
2. Pray and listen for whom you should consider your wise counselors.
3. After praying share who they may be (if you haven't discussed them already)
4. Pray and covenant that whomever you pick, both will trust or desire to develop trust
